# Android Application for WeMo and LifX Light Bulbs

This is a simple client application that can discover smart lights within our local network. Once the application is launched, it starts discovering all lights. Upon discovery, it displays the list of lights. From the list, we can perform several actions like power on/off, or make other changes based on what type of light we have discovered. For example, we can set different colors on the light if it is lifX. If there is multiple WeMo bulbs which belong to different WeMo switch(Bridge), we can discover and control each of them separately.
