# Android Application for WeMo and LifX Light Bulbs

This is a simple client application that can discover smart lights within our local network. Once the application is launched, it starts discovering all lights. Upon discovery, it displays the list of lights. From the list, we can perform several actions like power on/off, or make other changes based on what type of light we have discovered.
